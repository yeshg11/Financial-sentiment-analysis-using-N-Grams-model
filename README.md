Ngrams Model for Financial Sentiment Analysis: Read Me
I. Overview

This model uses N-grams to analyze the sentiment of financial text data, such as news articles, tweets, or company reports.

II. Model Details:

N-grams: The model extracts N-grams (sequences of N words) from the text data. Different N values can be used (e.g., unigrams, bigrams, trigrams).
Feature Engineering: N-grams are used as features for a machine learning model, such as Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines (SVM). Additional features like part-of-speech tagging or financial dictionary terms can be incorporated.
Training: The model is trained on labeled financial text data where each text instance has a sentiment label (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
